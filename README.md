# Cargo Connect Scorer
This is a scoring app for the 2021/2022 Lego League Challenge Board, Cargo Connect.  [More about the Lego League.](https://education.theiet.org/first-lego-league-programmes/)

It's a work in progress, but is designed to help coaches and teams quickly calculate the score from any timed run.  It will also feature a timer, and a back end will be added to keep track of your team's best run and which challenges they completed in that run.

It will be built firstly with mobile/iPad in mind, using React.
